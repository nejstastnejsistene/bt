A BitTorrent client that I wrote in high school. If I remember correctly, it was surprisingly functional considering I had only been programming for about a year. The main thing missing from this was the strategy used to select which chunks to request from which peers. I remember it being able to successfully discover, coordinate with, and download chunks from peers.
